excerpt: 'Relative errors are widely employed in sales forecasting and other domains to assess prediction accuracy due to its scale invariance and ease of comprehension. In this paper, with a homoscedastic Guassianity assumption, a novel model averaging approach based on multiplicative models and mean squared relative risk is proposed to improve the forecast accuracy measured by mean squared relative error. A theoretical guarantee that the expectation of the weight criterion is asymptotically equivalent to the relative risk is provided. Under some mild conditions, when all candidate models are misspecified the model averaging method is asymptotically optimal, and when correct models exist the sum of the weights placed on these correct models converges to 1. Furthermore, numerical experiments and an empirical analysis on sales forecasting show the superiority and practicability of the proposed method.'
