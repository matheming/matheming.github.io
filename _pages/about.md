Now I am pursuing a PhD offer with a degree of master majoring applied statistics. I was a master student majoring in Applied Probability in School of Management, USTC, fortunately advised by [Xinyu Zhang](https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/chinese/profile-578.html). Before that, I received my Bachelor degree in School of Mathematical Science, USTC. My research interests focus on Model Averaging, Relative Error, Causal Attribution and Efficient algorithm.
