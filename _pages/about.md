Now I am pursuing my PhD degree majoring in statistics in University of Science and Technology of China, USTC, fortunately advised by [Xinyu Zhang](https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/chinese/profile-578.html). Before that, I received my Master degree in School of Management and Bachelor degree in School of Mathematical Science in USTC. My research interests focus on Model Averaging, LLM and Interval Data.

My Erdos Number is 4.
